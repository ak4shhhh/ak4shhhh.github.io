# Header 1

I have completed all the required setup and published this page using GitHub. It's easy to write in Markdown through Obsidian, and after committing, GitHub automatically does its thing, and my static HTML site is ready. However, I currently have nothing to publish. But as I study the CPTS path from HTB Academy, I will store my notes here. If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me through my primary site listed below.
